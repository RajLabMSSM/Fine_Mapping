GARFIELD - GWAS analysis of regulatory of functional information enrichment with LD correction

GARFIELD is a functional enrichment analysis approach described in the paper "GARFIELD: GWAS analysis of regulatory of functional information enrichment with LD correction". Briefly, it is a method that leverages GWAS findings with regulatory or functional annotations (primarily from ENCODE and Roadmap epigenomics data) to find features relevant to a phenotype of interest. It performs greedy pruning of GWAS SNPs (LD r2 > 0.1) and then annotates them based on functional information overlap. Next, it quantifies enrichment as odds ratios (OR) at various GWAS significance cutoffs and assesses them by emplyong generalized linear model testing, while accounting for minor allele frequency, distance to nearest transcription start site and number of LD proxies (r2 > 0.8). Within this framework, GARFILED accounts for major sources of confounding that current methods do no offer.

We have implemented GARFIELD into a standalone tool using C++ for data pre-processing, and R for  enrichment estimation, significance testing and visualisation. It provides a way for assessing the enrichment of association analysis signals in 1005 features extracted from ENCODE, GENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, including genic annotations, chromatin states, histone modifications, DNaseI hypersensitive sites and transcription factor binding sites, among others, in a number of publicly available cell lines.

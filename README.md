# Fine_Mapping\

Identification of causal variants within genes that have been previously associated with Parkinson's Disease.\
All data and results can viewed and downloaded via the [interactive Rmarkdown output file]().\

## Methods\

We utilize a variety of statistical and functional fine mapping methodologies, including:
* [susieR](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR)
* [CAVIAR](http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/)
* [DAP](https://github.com/xqwen/dap)

## Data\

* PD-associated SNPs are from [Nalls et al. (2019)](https://github.com/neurogenetics/meta5)
* LD matrices are from the [1000 Genomes Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/),\
extracted using the [LDlink API](https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=apiaccess)

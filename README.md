#### echolocatoR is an open-source R library that wraps and extends several commonly used genetic and functional fine mapping tools:
* [susieR](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR)  
* [PAINTOR](https://github.com/gkichaev/PAINTOR_V3.0)  
* [CAVIAR](http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/)  
* [DAP](https://github.com/xqwen/dap)

# Fine_Mapping

Identification of causal variants within genes that have been previously associated with Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease.\
All data and results can viewed and downloaded via the following interactive Rmarkdown output files below:  

### Current Results
* [Fine mapping with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease GWAS Summary Stat Data](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/Fine_Mapping/Fine_Mapping.html)


### Alternative Analyses
* [Using LD matrix calculated from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 data (1/7/13); European superpopulation only](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/Fine_Mapping/Old_scripts/Fine_Mapping_1KGphase1_EUR.html)
* [Using LD matrix calculated from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data (7/14/16); European superpopulation only](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/Fine_Mapping/Old_scripts/Fine_Mapping_1KGphase3_EUR.html)
* [Using LD matrix calculated from 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 data (7/14/16); All populations](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/Fine_Mapping/Old_scripts/Fine_Mapping_1KGphase3_allPops.html)


## Methods

![Batty](./echolocatoR/images/echo_logo_sm.png)

#### echolatoR is an open-source R library that wraps and extends several commonly used genetic and functional fine mapping tools:
* [susieR](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR)  
* [PAINTOR](https://github.com/gkichaev/PAINTOR_V3.0)  
* [CAVIAR](http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/caviar/)  
* [DAP](https://github.com/xqwen/dap)  


## Data

### Parkinson's Disease GWAS

* [Nalls et al. (2019) & 23andMe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/388165v3)
    * Both Nalls et al. (2019) summary stats and 1000 Genomes Project LD calculations used human genome annotation GRCh37.


### Alzheimer's Disease GWAS

* [IGAP](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2802)
* [Marioni et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-018-0150-6)
* [Posthuma et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0311-9)
* [Kunkle et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0358-2)
